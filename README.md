# Predicting Stock Market Movements Using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
Predicting Stock Market Movements to Build an Optimal Portfolio Using Artificial Intelligence is one of the most challenging problems in time series data analysis. 
The method that will be used in this research to predict the best stocks is **Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)**. LSTM networks are extensions of **Recurrent Neural Networks** (RNNs) introduced primarily to deal with situations where RNNs fail.
